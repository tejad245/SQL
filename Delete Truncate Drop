DELETE removes rows one by one and can be rolled back. You can also apply a condition. it is DML command

TRUNCATE removes all rows quickly and can’t be rolled back in most systems. It resets identity counters too(It resets auto-increment values back to their starting value usually 1).
truncate is DDL command  
ex: TRUNCATE TABLE employee
why truncate is ddl . The database doesn’t delete rows one by one.
Instead, it deallocates all data pages used by the table.
That means:
It changes the metadata of the table (like resetting storage allocation).
It resets identity counters (in many databases).
It updates table definition info in system catalogs.

 What are the differences between OLTP and OLAP?
ANSWER – OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) handles day-to-day transactions, uses normalized databases, and focuses on quick updates of small amounts of data.
OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) is used for complex analysis, uses denormalized databases, and handles large volumes of historical data for reporting and analysis.

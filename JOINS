Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:
(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table , If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table , for the rows for which there is no matching row on the left side, the result-set will contain null
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: creates the result-set by combining results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.The result-set will contain all the rows from both tables. For the rows for which there is no matching, the result-set will contain NULL values.
Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table. 
CROSS JOIN : it returns noof rows=carteesian product of table a * and table b
NATURAL JOIN : It checks the common column present in both tables and matches them based on inner join and returns result.
if table A has country column and table B has country column, it matches those columns on inner join and returns, no need to specify the column name it identifies common column and returns result based on column name
if common column exists , if common column does not exits it returns the cartesian results A*B.

ex: of inner join,if exampl both table A and B have country column , it matches based on that column and returns.
select *
from Table A
natural join table B

CROSS JOIN
CROSS JOIN creates all possible combinations of two tables. CROSS JOIN does not require a field to join ON.
SELECT NAME, TITLE
FROM ARTIST
CROSS JOIN ALBUM;

SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,.... FROM table1  INNER JOIN
 table2 ON  table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;

->If both tables have null value on any row on which join is performed , null value match is performed in any kinda join its ignored.

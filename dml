DELETE is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) command used to remove one or more rows from a table based on a condition in the WHERE clause. It is reversible only if wrapped in a transaction (via ROLLBACK).

TRUNCATE is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command that removes all rows from a table by deallocating pages. It is faster but generally irreversible, and cannot be used on tables that are referenced by a foreign key.

DELETE is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) command used to remove one or more rows from a table based on a condition in the WHERE clause. It is reversible only if wrapped in a transaction (via ROLLBACK).

TRUNCATE is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command that removes all rows from a table by deallocating pages. It is faster but generally irreversible, and cannot be used on tables that are referenced by a foreign key

DROP deletes a table from the database completely, including the table structure and all the associated constraints, relationships with other tables, and access privileges. 
TRUNCATE deletes all rows from a table without affecting the table structure and constraints.
Both are DDL. DROP removes the table and its metadata; TRUNCATE deletes all rows but keeps the table definition. Performance and transactional behavior depend on the DB engine.

What is the impact of missing indexes?  
Missing indexes can affect the performance of queries, especially when the data grows. The major impacts of missing indexes are listed below:

1.Slow queries: Without indexes, every read query will go through the whole table to find matching rows. This will get worse as the data in the table grows.
2.Locking and concurrency issues: Scanning a table without indexes takes longer, and locking the table can prevent other queries from running, affecting application performance.
3.Inefficient joins: Joins on tables without indexes on the join keys are extremely slow and result in bad query performance.
4.Poor user experience: Missing indexes can lead to poor user experience in your applications. It can result to slower page loads, application hanging when data is being fetched from the database.

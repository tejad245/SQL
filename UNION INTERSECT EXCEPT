UNION:The UNION operator is used to vertically combine the results of two SELECT statements. For UNION to work without errors,
all SELECT statements must have the same number of columns and corresponding columns must have the same data type. UNION does not return duplicates.
SELECT ARTIST_ID
FROM ARTIST
UNION
SELECT ARTIST_ID
FROM ALBUM;

UNION ALL :The UNION ALL operator works just like UNION, but it returns duplicate values. The same restrictions of UNION hold true for UNION ALL
SELECT ARTIST_ID
FROM ARTIST
UNION ALL
SELECT ARTIST_ID
FROM ALBUM;

INTERSECT : The INTERSECT operator returns only identical rows from two tables.
SELECT ARTIST_ID
FROM ARTIST
INTERSECT
SELECT ARTIST_ID
FROM ALBUM;

EXCEPT : The EXCEPT operator returns only those rows from the left table that are not present in the right table.
SELECT ARTIST_ID
FROM ARTIST
EXCEPT
SELECT ARTIST_ID
FROM ALBUM;

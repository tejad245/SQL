Procedure: A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements stored in the database. In practice, these SQL statements can be executed multiple times.
One unique characteristic of a stored procedure is that it can accept parameters, perform complex operations, and return results. 
Stored procedures are used to encapsulate business logic, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance performance. Therefore, they reduce the need for multiple round trips between the application and the database.
Syntax:
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE procedure_name
(@parameter1 data_type, @parameter2 data_type, ...)
AS
BEGIN
   -- SQL statements to be executed
END

Execute the stored procedure above as follows:
Example : EXEC SelectAllCustomers;

User-Defined Stored Procedure: this stored procedure is created by users to encapsulate business logic
System Stored Procedure: it’s provided by the database system for administrative tasks, such as database management, troubleshooting, or system configuration.
Examples include: sp_help for viewing database object information , sp_rename for renaming database objects.
Extended Stored Procedure: it allows external programs to interact with the database system
